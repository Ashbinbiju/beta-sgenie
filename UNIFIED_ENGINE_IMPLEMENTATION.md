# Unified Analysis Engine - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 Project Objective
Rebuild the entire calculation and analysis system to combine all data sources (Zerodha, Streak, News, Market Context) into a single, powerful unified analysis engine for both **intraday** and **swing trading**.

## 📊 What Was Built

### 1. UnifiedAnalysisEngine Class
A comprehensive analysis engine that integrates **all** data sources:

**Data Sources Integrated:**
- ✅ **Zerodha APIs**
  - Shareholding Pattern (Promoter, FII, DII, Pledge)
  - Financials (5 sections: Summary, P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Ratios)
  
- ✅ **Streak APIs**
  - Technical Analysis (RSI, MACD, ADX, State, Win Rate)
  - Support & Resistance (Pivot, R1-R3, S1-S3)
  - Candlestick Data (visual confirmation)
  
- ✅ **News Sentiment Analysis**
  - Keyword-based sentiment scoring
  - Recency weighting (recent news gets 1.5x weight)
  - Impact on overall recommendation
  
- ✅ **Market Context**
  - Market Health Score (breadth, momentum, volatility)
  - Sector Performance alignment
  - Industry trends

### 2. Intelligent Scoring System

#### For SWING Trading (40% fundamental, 35% technical, 15% S/R, 5% news, 5% market):
```
Component Breakdown:

│   ├── Revenue Growth (0-25 pts)
│   ├── Profitability (OPM, NPM) (0-35 pts)
│   ├── Shareholding Pattern (0-25 pts)
│   └── Financial Health (ROE, D/E) (0-15 pts)
│
├── Technical Score (0-100)
│   ├── Trend State (0-30 pts)
│   ├── RSI (0-25 pts)
│   ├── MACD (0-15 pts)
│   ├── ADX - Trend Strength (0-15 pts)

    └── Industry Alignment (±15 pts)

Final Score = Base Score × Market Health Multiplier (0.7x to 1.1x)
```

#### For INTRADAY Trading (15% fundamental, 50% technical, 20% S/R, 10% news, 5% market):
```
- Emphasizes technical indicators and price action
- Higher weight on S/R levels for entry/exit timing
- News sentiment gets 2x weight (10% vs 5%)
- Market multiplier more aggressive (0.65x to 1.15x)
```

### 3. Safety Override System
**Critical safety mechanisms to prevent dangerous trades:**

✅ **Resistance Zone Overrides**
- Near R1: STRONG BUY → BUY, score capped at 72
- Near R2: BUY/STRONG BUY → MODERATE BUY, score capped at 70
- Near R3: All BUY signals → HOLD, score capped at 50

✅ **Promoter Pledge Overrides**
- Pledge > 90%: All BUY signals → HOLD
- Pledge > 75%: STRONG BUY → BUY

✅ **Market Crash Override**
- Market Health < 15: All BUY signals → HOLD

✅ **News Sentiment Override**
- Very negative news + STRONG BUY → BUY with warning

### 4. SWOT Analysis
Automatically generates:
- **Strengths** (💪): Positive fundamental/technical factors
- **Weaknesses** (📉): Areas of concern
- **Opportunities** (🎯): Entry zones, positive catalysts
- **Threats** (🚨): Critical risks, resistance zones

### 5. Confidence Scoring (0-100%)
Based on:
- Data availability (max 30 pts)
- Signal alignment across components (max 40 pts)
- Trend strength (max 15 pts)
- News recency (max 15 pts)
